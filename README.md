# Knowledge-Article-Bridge
A meta-repo to test POC of KB article backlinks to issues/PRs

This repo contains issues that act as a bridge to provide backlinks from a Knowledge Article (aka KB article) to other repositories issues/PRs.
Bridge issues provide visibility via an inbound link to the github issue/pr which can be followed to see any knowledge article that is referencing the issue or kb.
